            <p>My full name is Justin Patrick Durocher and I am currently enrolled in the UConn Coding Bootcamp hosted in Downtown Hartford, CT. I am twenty years old, orginally from New Hampshire but currently live right outside the city of hartford in Newington, CT. I work as a valet captain at the Goodwin Hotel and Capital Grille, and am hoping to find a better job after the course. In this program I will be learning to use the softwares HTML, CSS, Javascipt, JQuery, AJAX, Node.js.</p>
            <p>I first found interest in coding about a year ago when my friend showed me the basic ins and outs of html and css. It grasped my attention and fasinated me a lot. I am very motived to see how far my learning will be able to take me. I enjoy learning on my own at my own pace, unlike the two other universities I have attended.</p>
            <p>I have graduated from Newington High School in 2017 with a sports scholarship to play lacrosse or soccer at Springfield College. I decided to go with my favorite sport lacrosse. I had only two months of that until I had enough of the team and the school. The small school and very strict school just wasn't for me. I found no future in my major was well, which was sports management.  After the two months, I transferred to a local community college in Manchester, CT for buisness. I wasn't too interested in studying that field after the first year, and I had found more interest in coding and web development. This is why I am here today. I am here to prove that I do belong in this very difficult field.</p>
